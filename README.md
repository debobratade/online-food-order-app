Folder specification:
Sure! Here's the folder specification explained in simpler terms:

1. **config**: This folder holds all the configuration files for our application. These files control how our application behaves.

2. **controllers**: Here, we keep all the business logic of our application. These files handle the requests and responses, deciding what our application should do based on the incoming requests.

3. **dto** (data transfer object): This folder stores the definitions of the data structures used to transfer data between different parts of our application. For example, when we receive a request, we define what kind of data it should contain here.

4. **images**: All the images related to customers and vendors are stored in this folder. This includes profile pictures, product images, and any other images used in our application.

5. **middleware**: This folder contains all the functions that need to run before processing each request. These functions can perform tasks such as authentication, logging, or modifying the request before it reaches the controller.

6. **models**: Here, we store all the data models used in our application. These models represent the structure of our data and how it relates to each other.

7. **routes**: All the endpoints of our application are defined and organized in this folder. Each file corresponds to a different part of our API, making it easier to manage and understand.

8. **services**: This folder holds all the services related to our application. These services handle specific tasks or processes, such as sending emails, processing payments, or interacting with external APIs.

9. **utility**: Here, we store all the helper functions that are used across our application. These functions provide common functionality that can be reused in different parts of our codebase, making our code more modular and easier to maintain.
